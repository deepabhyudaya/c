Key Difference

Struct:
Stores all its members at the same time.
Each member gets its own memory space.
Use a struct when you need all the data fields simultaneously.

Union:
Stores only one member at a time.
All members share the same memory space.
Use a union when only one value is needed at any given time, and you want to save memory.
